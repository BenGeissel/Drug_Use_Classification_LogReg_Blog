# Drug_Use_Classification_LogReg_Blog
Logistic Regression used to predict Drug Use. This content was used for a blog post and later turned into a full project.

This notebook uses data from a study done about drug consumption and logistic regression to predict whether or not an individual has used a certain drug given certain demographic and personality traits about the individual.

UPDATE: The work here only utilizes logistic regression and is used for a blog, however this problem was turned into a full scale project using other types of classifiers. This work can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/BenGeissel/Predicting_Drug_Use_Mod5Project)

Data from: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Drug+consumption+%28quantified%29#)
